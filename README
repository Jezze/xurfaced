HALO
====

!!!THIS IS A VERY EARLY VERSION AND NOT THE FINAL PRODUCT!!!

Halo is a X11 window manager that uses Cairo's vector graphic library as the base for the user interface. It is ment to work in a simular fashion as the menu systems used for the PS3 or XBOX with the ability to load games, movies or whatever else you might think of.

USAGE
-----

Either put "exec halo" to your .xinitrc and type xinit or if you are already have an xserver running you can use the run.sh script to load halo into another tty (default 5).

FEATURES
--------

This is still a work in progress but this is what I've done so far.

* Handling of basic X11 events
* Spawning of new processes (mplayer, snes9x et.c.)
* Drawing of a basing Cairo interface
* A primitive menu system

TODO
----

* Animated graphics. (menus, fading)
* External configuration (perhaps using a config file or reading from stdin)
